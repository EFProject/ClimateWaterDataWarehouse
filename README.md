# ClimateWaterDataWarehouse
## A Data Warehouse Project for Integrating and Analyzing Climate and Water Quality Data

This repository contains a comprehensive data management project focused on integrating climate and water quality datasets. Using Python, PostgreSQL, and various data processing libraries, the project implements a dimensional model to store and analyze environmental data, providing valuable insights through ETL processes, data warehousing, and OLAP operations. The project includes code for data extraction, transformation, loading, and reporting, with a focus on supporting climate zone-dependent water quality thresholds.
